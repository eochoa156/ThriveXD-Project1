tic tac toe: 
-Player starts as X while the computer are Os
-First to get 3 in a row diagonal, horizontal or vertical wins
-Be warned the compter is a tough opponent!

For the tic-tac-toe game id like there to be different game modes: normal and diffulicult
with more time id make the normal game mode for the computerPlayer would pic a random stop instead of the best spot
with how the game is now the game is impossible to beat


Simon:
-First the computer then the player
-Player mut press the corresponding button that matches the one the compter pressed
-Try to score as high as you can!

for the simon game there is a innitial boop soun when you load up the page id like to get rid of.
the blue button is alos not changing color as drastically as id like so i would change the color more
id also like to add in a best score feature so the user would have incentive to play the game more.
A weird thing i found is that the h2 element dolesnt go above the gamepad, with more time id spend time to figure out what happened.

Overall for the game id like to add more games.
Make the home page more personalized and show the rules before each game insead of the home screen
